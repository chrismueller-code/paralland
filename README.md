# paralland

This is an example for parallel programming on android. It is taking the classical example of calculating pi in a huge number of steps. 
If you run it on different devices and look at it in cpu-profiler in Android Studio you can see how the threads are really running in parallel when using Kotlin coroutines. 
Also suggestions for unit tests for the calculations are present.
